Botanical.Cloud will be an open source science repository aimed at helping to overcome the Distributed Idea Suppression Complex (DISC) that has been and still can be found in the realm of theoretical plant biochemistry as well as in the realms of both empirical [in the lab, in field trials] or clinical plant biochemistry [by practitioners] out-of-the-mainstream topics like [plant bioaccoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_bioacoustics) or herbal medicine ... it's not just about the development of different botanical products into useful garden crops that can be grown by ordinary human beings, but more generally, it is about understanding Nature, plants and natural biophysical processes ... *this opening portion of an article was originally pushed to the Github repo only as a placeholder document ... check back later.*
