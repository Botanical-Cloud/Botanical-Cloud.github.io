title:  "Why Did We Ever Choose Photovoltaics?"

Why did we ever assume that the best thing that we can get from sunlight is volts/amps/watts or electrical power? Is our need for electricity just a tacit admission of how incredibly stupid we are? What if we could devise a solar collector that would give us high value nutraceuticals and medicines or particularlyuseful industrial chemicals or ... why did we not look a lot harder at Nature's approach to converting solar radiation to things of much higher value than mere electricity? Can we extend the biophysics of photosynthesis to convert other forms of radiation?
