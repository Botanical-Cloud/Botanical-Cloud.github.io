# About

Botanical.Cloud will be an open source science repository aimed at helping to overcome the Distributed Idea Suppression Complex (DISC) found in the realm of theoretical plant biochemistry, herbal medicine and the development of different botanical products into useful materials for human beings. 

The Botanical.Cloud repositories will be entirely open source and forkable ... in other words, this project is largely about what YOU make it.
